It's just divided by 11 instead of 10.\" Thinking quickly the entrepreneur says to the musician, \"For the right price I can get you one that goes to 12.\" :D XD\r\n\r\n### A Pun\r\nBoy: \"Hey babe I'm really sorry, I made you something.\"\r\n\r\nGirl: \"What did you make?\"\r\n\r\nBoy: \"falafels.\"\r\n\r\nGirl: \"Why?\"\r\n\r\nBoy: \"I told you I'm sorry, and well... I falafel.\" :D XD\r\n\r\n### A Story\r\nOnce upon a time a protagonist set out on an epic adventure. She faced great conflict but overcame them. Soon she encountered a troublesome antagonist. After an epic battle and a rising climax, she emerged victoriously and defeated the antagonist. Then she returned home and lived happily ever after. The End.\r\n\r\n### A Game\r\nRock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot! ...\r\n\r\nI choose rock. Always choose rock. :D XD\r\n",
